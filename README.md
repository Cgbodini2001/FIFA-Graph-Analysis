# FIFA Player Analysis 

In this project I will be analyzing FIFA ratings and overalls from the years 2016, 2017, and 2018.

## Description

I will be analyzing and distributing the data in graphs, using histograms and count graphs using the average ratings to identify wich country and team have the
higest and most consistent overall in the game. Then I will be grouping positions into more general positons and analyze each position to identify what attributes 
are more useful and more dominant per position.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Necesary Imports and Packages:
  Numpy,
  Pandas,
  Os,
  Seaborn,
  Matplotlib, 
  sklearn.linear_models,
  sklearn.metrics.

## Conclusions 

As we can see every year the top players change depending in the pefromance on the past year:
  2016 top players where in the order: 1 messi 2 ronaldo 3 a.robben 
  2017 top players where in order : 1 ronaldo 2 messi 3 neymar 
  2018 top players where in order: 1 ronaldo 2 messi 3 neymar 
We can also observe the change in the top teams how Fc barcelona was considered the best team in 2016
but following Juventus was considered the best in 2017, and 2018.
As well as seeing the change in the top nations. Finally my purpose was to find wich players and positions are 
suited with the top attribute we see in the average chart, the most important attribute cosistantly is pace and physic 
through out all positions, but we can identify the shift of importance in shooting amd dribbling along the years they have increased as players 
demand stronger shooters and dribblers to enjoy the game more. 
When focusing on the players themselves and each position, we can observe by the heatmaps that each position is more likely to have a certain
attribute higher than the other. For example players involved in the defense will obviusly have a high defesive attribute, but will also
have a higher physicality; On the other hand players more focused on offense will have higher shooting and dribbling attributes than defenders
but most will lack on phisicality. By doing so FIFA achieves a balanced gameplay and a more realistic feel to ntheir game.
